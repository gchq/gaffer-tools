# Contents and components

A list of the components, services, modules and other files contained in the
analytic-ui/src/app folder. (tests and .spec.ts files have not been included, as their purpose of testing is implicit).


- **analytic** - The files representing each analytic, which creates a card with the title of said analytic, an icon, and fills in with a specified colour. When clicked, this then calls services which populate the parameters page, which is subsequently navigated to.
- **analytics** - The analytics screen, displaying a grid of analytic components each of which corresponds to an analytic created in the restAPI.
- **config**
  - **endpoint.service.ts** - Holds the URL of the restAPI.
- **dynamic-input**
  - **error.service.ts** - Used to create toast notifications when errors occur.
- **g**
  - **analytics.service.ts** - Used to load analytics from the REST API, store the chosen analytic, and execute the analytic.
  - **query.service.ts** - Sends a http request to the REST API to execute the final analytic.
  - **results.service.ts** - Used to store the results of the analytic operation and to update and clear the table of results.
  - **schema.service.ts** - Used to get the schema from the restAPI, update it, and store it.
  - **time.service.ts** - Provides and checks the valid units of time permitted within the application; i.e. if something is a time, it must be in days, minutes, hours, or some other valid unit of time.
  - **nav** - Holds the overall layout of the final product, including the toolbar and home button/title at the top, and the component display/page content area.
- **operation** - The component on the parameter input screen where the user enters their parameters, including seeds, date ranges and other inputs necessary for the running of their chosen analytic.
- **parameter-form** - Used in the operation component to allow the generation of the inputs necessary user to give inputs for each of the parameters on their chosen analytic.
- **parameter-input** - The parameter input screen, which contains the operation component, and the execute button which allows the user to execute the analytic.
- **table** - The results screen and the card which hold the table of results generated by the executed analytic.
- **app-routing.module.ts** - Where the different routes/urls of the different pages are defined/generated.
- **app.component** - The root app component.
- **app.module.ts** - Where all of the components, services and other imported modules used in the app are defined.
- **material.module.ts** - Imports all used material angular components for the entire app, so that if used in one component, they can be easily brought across into others.
