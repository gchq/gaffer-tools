## Gaffer Schema Builder

This tool is intended to help with the process of creating a schema for a Gaffer instance. Currently the tool is made up of a front-end \(Javascript\) and a back-end \(Java\). At this stage of development both are required to be running on the same host, the UI is expecting to find the back-end on "localhost:8080".

This store is experimental, the API is unstable and may require breaking changes.

### How to run

Please see the relevent README files in the sub-directories of this folder for more detailed information about each service.
