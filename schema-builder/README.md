# Deprecated

Due to the fact this module is not maintained and doesn't seem to work very well, it has been [deprecated](https://github.com/gchq/gaffer-tools/issues/947) as of 17/11/21. We plan to delete it at some point in the Gaffer 2 release process. We suspect this will not bother anyone as it seems no one uses it, but if this isn't the case then please let us know in this [issue](https://github.com/gchq/gaffer-tools/issues/930).

## Gaffer Schema Builder

This tool is intended to help with the process of creating a schema for a Gaffer instance. Currently the tool is made up of a front-end \(Javascript\) and a back-end \(Java\). At this stage of development both are required to be running on the same host, the UI is expecting to find the back-end on "localhost:8080".

This store is experimental, the API is unstable and may require breaking changes.

### How to run

Please see the relevent README files in the sub-directories of this folder for more detailed information about each service.
